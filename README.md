Geneva is a highly active yet small place, and thus, resources, such as office space or qualified workforce, are scarce and most often pricey. 

As a result, a lot of ventures initiated locally don't make it as startup because of the necessary upfront costs. Here we think how to relieve costs, or the alleviate disadvantages by leveraging unconsidered economic, political or cultural resources.

## Scarce resources :
- office space is expensive
- qualified workforce may be over expensive or even unavailable, compared to neighborhing places and countries.
- sales lifecycle : it make take a long time to make deal. This time may be beyond what a startup can afford. One can explain this by a slow-moving (yet with momentum) culture, including smart follower strategies.
